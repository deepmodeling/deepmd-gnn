`deepmd-mace` is a [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) plugin for [DeePMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit), which enables MACE models in DeePMD-kit.

After installing the plugin, one can train the MACE model using DeePMD-kit, run active learning cycles for the MACE model using [DP-GEN](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen), perform simulations with the MACE model using molecular dynamic packages supported by DeePMD-kit, such as [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps).
